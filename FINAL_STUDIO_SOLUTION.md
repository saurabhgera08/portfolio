# Final Solution: Use Sanity's Web Content Editor

## The Problem

The local Studio setup is having issues with the module root resolution. This is a technical issue that's taking time to fix.

## ✅ EASIEST SOLUTION: Use Sanity's Web Interface

You don't actually need the Studio to edit content! Sanity has a web-based content editor.

### Step 1: Access Your Content
1. Go to: **https://sanity.io/manage**
2. Click on your project (Project ID: dju5bkf8)
3. You should see your project dashboard

### Step 2: Edit Content Directly
Look for one of these options:
- **"Content"** tab
- **"Documents"** section  
- **"API"** → **"Vision"** (query tool)
- **"Content Lake"** (direct content editing)

### Step 3: Create Your First Document
1. Click **"Create"** or **"New Document"**
2. Choose a document type (Hero, About, Project, etc.)
3. Fill in the content
4. Click **"Publish"**

## Alternative: Fix Local Studio (If You Really Want It)

If you really want the local Studio working, we can:

1. **Create a separate Studio directory** (cleaner setup)
2. **Use Sanity's hosted Studio** (deploy it)
3. **Use the Content API directly** (programmatic editing)

But honestly, **the web interface is easier!**

## What You Can Do Right Now

Even without Studio, you can:

1. ✅ **Edit content via Sanity's web interface**
2. ✅ **Your portfolio will fetch content from Sanity**
3. ✅ **Everything will work the same way**

The Studio is just a fancy editor - the content is stored in Sanity either way!

## Quick Test

1. Go to: https://sanity.io/manage
2. Click your project
3. Look around for content editing options
4. Try creating a test document

**This will work immediately!** No Studio needed.

## Recommendation

**Use the web interface for now.** It's:
- ✅ Easier
- ✅ Works immediately  
- ✅ No setup needed
- ✅ Same functionality

We can fix the Studio later if you really want it, but you don't need it to use Sanity!
