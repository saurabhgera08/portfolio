# Sanity Free Tier Explained

## Is Sanity Really Free Forever?

### ✅ YES! Sanity has a generous **free tier** that never expires.

## What You're Seeing

When you see "Trial" in Sanity, it usually means:
- **Trial of additional features** (like advanced analytics, team features)
- **NOT a trial of the core CMS** - that's free forever!

## Sanity Free Tier Includes:

### ✅ **Free Forever:**
- **Unlimited projects**
- **Unlimited documents** (content entries)
- **Unlimited API requests** (for reading content)
- **10GB asset storage** (images, files)
- **Unlimited bandwidth** for assets
- **Full CMS features** (all content types, Studio, etc.)
- **Image optimization** and CDN
- **Real-time updates**

### 💰 **Paid Features** (Optional):
- More asset storage (if you exceed 10GB)
- Team collaboration features
- Advanced analytics
- Priority support

## For Your Portfolio:

**You'll NEVER need to pay** because:
- ✅ Portfolio content is small (< 1GB)
- ✅ You're the only editor
- ✅ Free tier covers everything you need
- ✅ No limits on API requests for reading

## What Happens After "Trial"?

**Nothing!** Your core CMS features continue working forever.

The "trial" is just for:
- Advanced team features
- Premium support
- Extra storage (if you need it)

**Your portfolio will work perfectly on the free tier forever.**
