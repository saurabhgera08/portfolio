# ✅ You DON'T Need Studio to Add Content!

## The Good News

**You can add content to Sanity WITHOUT setting up a Studio!** The Studio is just a fancy editor - you can add content directly through Sanity's API.

---

## Step 1: Access Your Project Content

Even without Studio, you can add content. Here's how:

### Option A: Use Sanity Vision (Query Tool)

1. Go to: **https://sanity.io/manage**
2. Click on your project (`dju5bkf8`)
3. Look for **"API"** → **"Vision"** (or "Query" tool)
4. This lets you query and see your content structure

### Option B: Use Content API Directly

You can add content using a simple script or through Sanity's Content API.

## Step 2: Add Content Using a Script (Easiest!)

I'll create a script that adds all your content to Sanity. You just need to run it!

### What You Need:

1. **Your Sanity API Token** (I'll show you how to get it)
2. **Run the script** I'll create for you

---

## Step 3: Get Your API Token

1. Go to: https://sanity.io/manage
2. Click your project
3. Go to **"API"** → **"Tokens"**
4. Click **"Add API Token"**
5. Name it: `Portfolio Token`
6. Choose permissions: **"Editor"** (can read and write)
7. Copy the token (starts with `sk...`)

## Step 4: Add Content

Once you have the token, I'll create a script that:
- ✅ Adds Hero content
- ✅ Adds About content
- ✅ Adds Contact info
- ✅ Adds Work Experience
- ✅ Adds Projects
- ✅ Adds Books
- ✅ Adds Skills

**You just run one command and all your content is added!**

---

## What About Studio?

**Studio is optional!** It's just a visual editor. You can:
- ✅ Add content via API (script) - **Easiest!**
- ✅ Add content via Vision (query tool)
- ✅ Add content via Content API
- ✅ Set up Studio later (if you want the visual editor)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Get your API token** (Step 3 above)
2. **Share it with me** (or keep it safe)
3. **I'll create a script** that adds all your content
4. **Run the script** - content is added!
5. **Your portfolio fetches it automatically!**

## Quick Answer

**You don't need Studio!** Just get your API token and I'll create a script to add all your content. Much easier than setting up Studio!
